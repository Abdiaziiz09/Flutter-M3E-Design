An independent, source-traceable guide for implementing Flutter interfaces informed by Material 3 Expressive (M3 Expressive). This repository is not an official Google or Flutter specification and does not certify conformance.

## What this repository covers

[![The expressive color system can create a wide range of accessible palettes](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmoi9819i-blog4.png?alt=media)](https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive)

*Official Material illustration about expressive color palettes; see the [source article](https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive).*

- Material 3 Expressive design intent, scope, and evidence labels.
- Foundations, component selection, Flutter theming, and custom implementation decisions.
- Flutter targets: Android, iOS, web, Windows, macOS, and Linux, with platform limitations called out.
- Responsive/adaptive layouts, accessibility, localization, testing, and AI-agent workflows.

Flutter's Material library implements Material Design components and theming. Setting `ThemeData.useMaterial3` selects Flutter's Material 3 behavior; it does **not** prove that every M3 Expressive component, motion treatment, or platform behavior is implemented. Use the [support matrix](docs/reference/support-matrix.md) and [component verification ledger](docs/reference/component-verification-ledger.md) to determine what is API verified, configurable, custom, platform-dependent, or unverified.

## Foundation examples

### Typography

[![The updated type scale includes new emphasized text styles](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmoi65wlg-blog1.png?alt=media)](https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive)

*Official Material illustration; the article caption identifies the updated type scale and emphasized text styles. See the [source article](https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive).*

### Shape

[![Material shape library example](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fm3%2Fimages%2Fmoi7e8z9-blog3.png?alt=media)](https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive)

*Official Material illustration; the article says its shape library includes 35 iconic shapes. See the [source article](https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive).*

For color roles, elevation, spacing, icons, motion, accessibility, and responsive design, use the [foundations guide](docs/foundations/index.md). Exact values are included only where the cited source supports them; unspecified values are not guessed.

*Official Material example of expressive component styling. See the [source article](https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive).*

The examples below are served from Google's Material Design hosting and link to the relevant official component guidance. They illustrate design intent; they are not Flutter renderings or proof of M3 Expressive parity.

### Buttons

*Official Material image. Read the [buttons guidance](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/overview).*

### Cards

### Navigation bar

*Official Material image. The page describes the Expressive navigation bar as shorter than the baseline. Read the [navigation bar guidance](https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-bar/overview).*

### Chips

For other component mappings, applicable states, Flutter SDK evidence, and visual-test gaps, see the [component catalog](docs/components/index.md), [component coverage matrix](docs/reference/component-coverage.md), and [verification ledger](docs/reference/component-verification-ledger.md).

The [Phase 0/1 audit](docs/reference/m3e-phase0-1-audit.md) records the documentation-readiness rubric and its limitations. Its [38-entry component inventory](docs/reference/m3e-master-component-inventory.csv) and [source-evidence ledger](docs/reference/m3e-source-evidence-ledger.csv) are audit artifacts, not M3E conformance claims.

## Start implementing

[![Material 3 Expressive navigation bar visual example](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fmae7qe43-02.png?alt=media)](https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-bar/overview)

*Official Material component reference; Flutter support and appearance must be checked separately.*

1. Read [scope and terminology](docs/getting-started/scope.md), [support matrix](docs/reference/support-matrix.md), and [AI-agent instructions](AGENTS.md).
2. Identify the target Flutter version, platforms, input modes, localization/RTL needs, and accessibility requirements.
3. Follow the relevant foundation and component pages. Separate official Material guidance from Flutter API facts and repository recommendations.
4. Prefer built-in Flutter Material widgets when their verified behavior meets the requirement. Add custom work only for a documented gap.
5. Run the [validation checklist](docs/ai-agent-guide/validation-checklist.md) and applicable tests; report what was not tested.

```dart
MaterialApp(
  theme: ThemeData(
    useMaterial3: true,
    colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
      seedColor: const Color(0xFF6750A4),
    ),
  ),
  home: const MyHomePage(),
)
```

This is a Material 3 Flutter starting point, not an M3 Expressive compliance recipe. Define light/dark schemes, typography, and component themes deliberately, then validate the implementation against the applicable guidance.

## Build and validate

[![Material 3 Expressive button update example](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/design-spec/o/projects%2Fgoogle-material-3%2Fimages%2Fmmm1tos0-03.png?alt=media)](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/overview)

*Official button visual reference. Use actual Flutter/platform captures as well as automated tests when validating a product.*

Build the documentation from the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/validate_docs.py
python scripts/validate_links.py
mkdocs build --strict
```

Validate the standalone Flutter example from `examples/flutter/reference_app/`:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

Flutter widget-test goldens are regression fixtures for the test renderer, not browser/device screenshots; see the [testing guide](docs/flutter/testing.md). No single automated test establishes accessibility or M3 Expressive conformance.

Material's interactive pages may not expose every specification detail through text retrieval. The [source catalog](docs/reference/official-sources.md) and [component verification ledger](docs/reference/component-verification-ledger.md) state what was actually checked. Visuals and behavior still require review on each intended platform, with relevant text scales, locales, input modes, and assistive technologies.
