# Flutter-M3E-Design: Improvements Needed for Production Readiness

**Target repository:** https://github.com/Abdiaziiz09/Flutter-M3E-Design
**Review date:** 2026-10-24
**Targets:** Flutter on Android, iOS, and desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Purpose of this file:** a prioritized, source-backed list of what must change before this repository can be called a complete, production-ready Material 3 Expressive (M3E) reference. It is a plan, not a record of completed work.

---

## 0. What this review is based on, and what it is not

**Reviewed (read directly):** the repository landing page and README, `link_sources.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/reference/m3e-phase0-1-audit.md`, `docs/reference/component-verification-ledger.md`, `docs/flutter/testing.md`, `docs/platforms/index.md`.

**Not done in this review:**

- No code was changed, and nothing was pushed to the repository.
- `flutter test`, `flutter analyze`, `python scripts/validate_docs.py`, `python scripts/validate_links.py` and `mkdocs build --strict` were **not run**. No Flutter toolchain or repository checkout was available.
- The contents of `examples/flutter/reference_app/` could not be opened (the page blocks automated access). Statements about the app below come from the repository's own ledger and README, not from reading the Dart files.
- The platform guides for Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS and Linux were not individually opened. Only the platform index was read.

Anything in this plan that depends on those files is marked **(verify)**.

## 1. Where the repository stands today

| Area | Current state | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Positioning | Independent, source-traceable guide. Explicitly *not* an official spec and makes no conformance claim. | README |
| Readiness score | **57/100** documentation-readiness (not conformance). A separately mentioned 68% is not reproducible and is not used. | Phase 0/1 audit |
| Weakest dimensions | Foundations/tokens 7/20; Flutter implementation 6/10; components 10/25; accessibility/motion 7/10; platforms 10/15 | Phase 0/1 audit |
| Component inventory | 38 entries (9 M3E updated, 5 M3E new, 24 baseline or unconfirmed) | Phase 0/1 audit |
| Evidence quality | Mostly **E1 (metadata only)**: HTTP 200, page title, description. No exact dimensions, tokens, motion or full state specs were inspected. | Component ledger |
| Flutter snapshot | Reports Flutter 3.47.7 stable / Dart 3.13.5 with the **in-framework** Material library | Component ledger |
| Sample app | A Material 3 baseline (`useMaterial3: true` plus `ColorScheme.fromSeed`), not an M3E component library | README, audit |
| Tests | Widget-test goldens (overview and search, light/dark, narrow/wide) plus a few interaction tests. Goldens use the Ahem test font, so text renders as blocks. | Ledger, testing guide |
| Token registry | None. The audit's gate says exact token values must not be assigned until sources reach E3. | Audit |

**Strengths to preserve:** the evidence-grade vocabulary (E0–E4), the refusal to equate `useMaterial3: true` with M3E, the "report what was not tested" completion note in `AGENTS.md`, and the dated, honest ledger.

## 2. Corrections to the working brief

Several assumptions in the task brief do not hold against what I could verify. Fixing the plan around them avoids building on bad premises.

1. **`AdaptiveScaffold` should not be the foundation.** `flutter_adaptive_scaffold` is marked **discontinued** on pub.dev. Community forks exist (for example `canonical_adaptive_scaffold`, `adaptive_scaffold_router`), but none is first-party. Recommended: build the responsive recipes from `LayoutBuilder` plus `NavigationBar` / `NavigationRail` / `NavigationDrawer` with a repo-owned window-size-class helper. Treat any fork as optional and label it third-party.
2. **`golden_toolkit` should not be adopted.** It is discontinued on pub.dev. `alchemist` (0.14.0 at time of search, MIT) is the maintained successor in the same style. Pin its version after checking compatibility with the pinned Flutter SDK **(verify)**.
3. **"Official `M3ESegmentedList` blueprint" does not exist in any source I found.** "Segmented Lists" and "card list" appear as component names in the community package `m3e_core`. Treat `M3ESegmentedList` as a *repository-defined* widget and label it "Custom Implementation Choice". I could not confirm that an `M3ECardList` exists in this repo **(verify)**.
4. **"35 iconic shapes"** comes from Material's blog article, which the README quotes. I found no verified Flutter API that exposes all 35. A community package (`material_new_shapes`) provides morphing polygon shapes. Mapping all 35 into a `ThemeExtension` requires the official shape list as a source first.
5. **"Typography Flex scales"**: I found no source for this term. The README states exact expressive type-token values are not assumed. Do not implement it until a source is cited.
6. **"15 baseline M3E features"**: the audit notes that Flutter's umbrella issue says fifteen components but lists fourteen. Reconcile against the live Material catalog before freezing scope.
7. **Spring motion values**: Material's motion physics are described by the repo only at topic level. No spring stiffness or damping values were retrieved. Mark them "Unspecified - Custom Implementation Choice" until sourced.
8. **`context.m3e.spacing`** is a *project-defined* extension, which is fine, but its values are not official Material tokens. Label them as repository choices.

## 3. The `material_ui` migration: what is verified

- Flutter's migration guide confirms the Material library is now a standalone package, `package:material_ui`, and that contributions to `package:flutter/material.dart` were **frozen starting in Flutter 3.44**.
- Import change: `package:flutter/material.dart` → `package:material_ui/material_ui.dart`; add with `flutter pub add material_ui`.
- Types are **not interchangeable** across the two imports. A file must not import both.
- Localization delegates moved into the new packages.
- `MaterialUiCompatibilityBridge` exists for third-party subtrees that still import the old library.
- Flutter's umbrella issue #168813 states that new M3E work happens in the new packages. The button-group and button M3E proposals (#184936, #184937) were Backlog at audit time, so **API existence must be verified per component against the pinned version**, not assumed.
- One community M3E package already requires `material_ui ^1.1.0` and Flutter ≥ 3.44.0.

**Migration risks to plan for**

- The repo's evidence ledger was gathered against the in-framework library. Every "API verified" row needs re-verification against the pinned `material_ui` version.
- Existing goldens will need regeneration and a documented reason for each diff.
- Third-party packages used by the sample may still import the old library (use the compatibility bridge or replace them).

## 4. Prioritized backlog

Priorities: **P0** blocks any production-ready claim, **P1** required for M3E alignment, **P2** required for platform completeness, **P3** polish.

### P0: Foundations and trust

- [ ] **Pin the toolchain.** Record Flutter, Dart, `material_ui` and `cupertino_ui` versions in `pubspec.yaml`, CI and docs. State the supported range.
- [ ] **Migrate the reference app to `material_ui`.** Single import per file; run `flutter analyze` clean; regenerate goldens; document each diff.
- [ ] **Re-verify the ledger against the pinned package.** Replace "reported by repository snapshot" with a re-run, dated check.
- [ ] **Raise evidence from E1 to E3** for every component, starting with the five M3E-new ones: button groups, split button, FAB menu, loading indicator, toolbars. Record anatomy, variants, states, dimensions and motion from the official page, or mark each missing value **"Unspecified - Custom Implementation Choice"**.
- [ ] **Build the token registry** (color roles, type scale, shape, elevation, spacing, motion). No value without a citation. This is the audit's stated gate before component contracts.
- [ ] **Resolve scope discrepancies:** the 14-vs-15 component count; the 38-row inventory's overlap rules; the missing dedicated bottom app bar row.
- [ ] **Wire CI.** Run `validate_docs.py`, `validate_links.py`, `mkdocs build --strict`, `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` on every pull request. Publish actual results.

### P1: M3E components and theming

- [ ] **`ThemeExtension` for M3E tokens** (shape, type, spacing, motion) with `copyWith`, `lerp`, light/dark variants and a documented source for each field.
- [ ] **Shape mapping:** source the official 35-shape list first, then implement. Document which shapes have no Flutter API.
- [ ] **Dedicated contracts and widgets** for: connected/standard button groups (not `SegmentedButton`), split button, FAB menu, loading indicator, toolbars, expressive app bars, extended FAB.
- [ ] **Segmented/card list pattern** as a clearly labeled custom component (see §2 item 3), including reorder and morph behavior only where a source or a documented project decision supports it.
- [ ] **Motion:** a documented spring-based motion layer with a reduced-motion fallback. Values must be sourced or labeled custom.
- [ ] **Deprecation audit:** list every component that uses a deprecated or migration-sensitive API and justify it (this is already an `AGENTS.md` rule).

### P1: Testing

- [ ] **Replace Ahem-font goldens** with real-font goldens using `alchemist` (or Flutter's built-in `matchesGoldenFile` with loaded fonts). Keep CI goldens deterministic across OSes.
- [ ] **State matrix tests** for each component: default, hover, focus, pressed, selected, disabled, loading, error, expanded.
- [ ] **Text scale and locale matrix:** test the largest relevant platform text settings, plus optional project-defined 1.0 / 1.5 / 2.0 scale scenarios, long strings, RTL, and one non-Latin locale. The 2.0 scenario is not a universal platform maximum.
- [ ] **Accessibility tests:** semantics, minimum tap target (`kMinInteractiveDimension`), contrast checks via Flutter's `meetsGuideline` matchers, keyboard traversal.
- [ ] **`integration_test`** on at least one Android and one iOS target, plus one desktop target.

### P2: Platforms (Android, iOS, desktop)

- [ ] **Confirm runner folders** (`android/`, `ios/`, `macos/`, `windows/`, `linux/`) exist in the reference app and build in CI **(verify)**.
- [ ] **Android:** edge-to-edge and system-bar handling, predictive back, dynamic color, large-screen and foldable behavior. Validate on real devices or emulators and record results.
- [ ] **iOS:** safe areas, back-swipe, text-scale and Dynamic Type behavior, haptics, and a documented decision on when to use `cupertino_ui` adaptive widgets versus Material.
- [ ] **Desktop:** pointer hover states, keyboard focus rings and shortcuts, window resizing across breakpoints, scrollbar behavior, text selection, and menu-bar conventions per OS.
- [ ] **Per-platform pages** (`docs/platforms/*.md`): add a "tested / not tested" table with date, device, OS and Flutter version.
- [ ] **Responsive recipes** for compact / medium / expanded widths using `LayoutBuilder`, with canonical layouts (list-detail, supporting pane, feed). Cite Material's layout and breakpoint pages from `link_sources.md`.

### P2: AI-agent workflow (`AGENTS.md`)

- [ ] **Add a "no magic numbers" rule** (proposed text in §5).
- [ ] **Add an error-handling section** with failing and corrected examples (proposed in §5).
- [ ] **Remove the duplicated "Required completion note"** heading that currently appears twice.
- [ ] **Add a lint rule or script** that fails CI on literal `EdgeInsets`, `SizedBox` and radius numbers in `lib/` outside the token files.
- [ ] **Make `llms-full.txt` genuinely full** or document clearly that it is an index only (the audit flags that agents given only that file miss normative content).

### P3: Polish

- [ ] Fix the topic typo `accessiblity` in repository topics.
- [ ] Add a `docs/` page showing real Flutter screenshots next to the official Material images, clearly captioned.
- [ ] Add release tags, a versioned changelog, and a "tested against" badge.
- [ ] Track license terms for any image reuse (the README currently hotlinks Google-hosted images, which is the right default).

## 5. Proposed additions to `AGENTS.md`

### 5.1 Mandatory rule: no magic numbers

> **Layout values must come from tokens.** Do not write numeric literals for padding, margins, gaps, radii, icon sizes or breakpoints in widget code. Use `context.m3e.spacing`, `context.m3e.shape` or another declared token. If no token exists, add one to the token file with a source citation, or label it **"Unspecified - Custom Implementation Choice"**. Framework constants such as `kMinInteractiveDimension` are allowed.

```dart
// Not allowed
Padding(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
  child: child,
)

// Allowed (token names are repository-defined; values are labeled custom unless sourced)
Padding(
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(context.m3e.spacing.medium),
  child: child,
)
```

### 5.2 Error-handling scenarios

**Scenario A: Row overflows ("RIGHT OVERFLOWED BY n PIXELS")**

```dart
// Failing: unbounded text inside a Row
Row(children: [Icon(Icons.info), Text(longLabel)])

// Resolution: give the text bounded space and a defined overflow behavior
Row(
  children: [
    const Icon(Icons.info),
    SizedBox(width: context.m3e.spacing.small),
    Expanded(
      child: Text(longLabel, maxLines: 2, overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis),
    ),
  ],
)
```

**Scenario B: Truncation at large text scale**

```dart
// Failing: fixed height clips scaled text
SizedBox(height: 56, child: Text(label))

// Resolution: a minimum height that grows with content
ConstrainedBox(
  constraints: const BoxConstraints(minHeight: kMinInteractiveDimension),
  child: Text(label),
)
```

Required check: verify the widget at the largest relevant platform text settings. The project may additionally run a 2.0 scale scenario (for example, through `MediaQuery` or the test platform dispatcher) and confirm no overflow, clipping, or unreachable controls; 2.0 is a project test value, not a universal platform maximum.

**Scenario C: Controls crowd or wrap at narrow widths**

Prefer `Wrap` or an overflow pattern over shrinking tap targets below `kMinInteractiveDimension`. Document the chosen behavior in the component contract.

## 6. Definition of done (per component)

A component is "M3E-aligned" only when **all** of these are recorded:

1. Official source reviewed at **E3**, with date and scope.
2. Flutter API path stated (`material_ui` version) or "custom, because …".
3. Every applicable state tested, with unsupported states listed.
4. Text-scale, RTL and long-content tests pass.
5. Accessibility checks pass (semantics, target size, contrast, keyboard).
6. Tested on named Android, iOS and desktop targets, or the gaps are reported.
7. Tokens used; no magic numbers.

Required commands (all must be run and their real output reported):

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/validate_docs.py
python scripts/validate_links.py
mkdocs build --strict

cd examples/flutter/reference_app
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter test integration_test   # only where devices are configured
```
