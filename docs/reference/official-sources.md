# Source catalog

Reviewed 2026-10-23 where access status says **Verified**. "Verified" means the URL resolved and its title or relevant API content was inspected; it does not mean every page detail was extracted. Material Design uses interactive pages, and some could not be retrieved in text. Re-check upstream before relying on version-sensitive claims.

### Component deep-dive sources reviewed 2026-10-24

The following canonical Material component pages were checked by title and text-accessible description/metadata. Several pages rely on interactive content that was not fully extractable; this is not exhaustive verification of their diagrams, token values, behavior, states, or version history. The deep-dive page therefore cites these for purpose/variant identification and directs readers to inspect the current component page for detailed requirements.

| Component source | URL | What the accessible source confirms | Limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Button groups | https://m3.material.io/components/button-groups/overview | Page describes groups as organizing buttons and adding interactions. | Detailed anatomy/variants not fully inspected. |
| Split buttons | https://m3.material.io/components/split-button/overview | Page describes a menu of options related to an action. | Interaction states and visual specification not fully inspected. |
| FAB menu | https://m3.material.io/components/fab-menu/overview | Page describes multiple related actions opening from a FAB. | Full motion/anatomy guidance not extracted. |
| Badges | https://m3.material.io/components/badges/overview | Page describes notification, count, or status information attached to navigation items/icons; labels or numbers may be used. | Detailed usage guidance not fully extracted. |
| Divider | https://m3.material.io/components/divider/overview | Page describes a thin line grouping content in lists and containers. | Detailed variants and usage guidance not fully extracted. |
| Side sheets | https://m3.material.io/components/side-sheets/overview | Page identifies standard and modal side sheets for secondary side-anchored content. | Detailed behavior/layout guidance not fully extracted. |
| Time pickers | https://m3.material.io/components/time-pickers/overview | Page identifies dial and input types. | Detailed state/locale/token guidance not fully extracted. |

### Component API sources checked 2026-10-24


| Component APIs checked 2026-10-24 | Flutter API | API fact used in the component deep dive | Version limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Segmented button | https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SegmentedButton-class.html | Bounded option selection; single-select default and optional multi-select. | Verify API and behavior against the app SDK. |
| Menu anchor | https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MenuAnchor-class.html | Anchored-menu building block; not itself a split button or FAB menu specification. | Verify focus/placement behavior against the app SDK and targets. |
| Badge | https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Badge-class.html | Optional label; Flutter API describes small and labeled badge forms. | API existence does not establish M3E parity or announcement behavior. |
| Divider | https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Divider-class.html | Separator widget with documented list/drawer use. | Verify selected SDK and semantic output. |
| Scaffold end drawer | https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold/endDrawer.html | Side panel attached to scaffold edge; drawer API is not a side-sheet equivalence claim. | Verify directionality and behavior in the app SDK. |
| Time picker | https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/showTimePicker.html | Dialog API exposes entry mode and returns selected time or cancellation. | Verify locale, theming, and behavior against the app SDK. |

## Packages and implementation repositories

| Title | Publisher / category | URL | Supports | Status and limitations |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Platform, accessibility, web, and testing

Use current official references for [Android](https://developer.android.com/design/ui), [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/), [Microsoft Fluent design](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/design/), [W3C WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), and [Flutter platform integration](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration). These were identified as authoritative starting points but their detailed claims were not individually verified in this review; consult the target platform and current version directly.

## Preserved starting URLs

The full originally supplied list is preserved in the repository-root `link_sources.md`. A listed URL is not automatically a verified source; this catalog marks access limits explicitly.
