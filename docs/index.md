# M3 Expressive implementation reference

This independent guide helps teams build Material 3 Expressive-informed interfaces with Flutter while keeping design guidance, Flutter API behavior, and implementation choices distinct.

## Start

- Read [scope and terminology](getting-started/scope.md) before applying design claims.
- Check [platform and feature support](reference/support-matrix.md).
- Use the [38-entry component inventory](reference/m3e-master-component-inventory.csv), [source-evidence ledger](reference/m3e-source-evidence-ledger.csv), and [Phase 0/1 audit](reference/m3e-phase0-1-audit.md) to distinguish listed topics from verified requirements.
- Navigate [foundations](foundations/index.md), [components](components/index.md), [Flutter](flutter/index.md), and [platform guidance](platforms/index.md).
- For agents, begin with the repository-root `AGENTS.md` and [workflow](ai-agent-guide/implementation-workflow.md).

## Evidence and dates

Source links and access notes are maintained in [the catalog](reference/official-sources.md). Source retrieval was performed on 2026-10-23 where marked verified. Material's interactive site does not expose every detail through text retrieval; verify design assets and current content directly before relying on specific geometry. Exact values absent from accessible authoritative text are deliberately not reproduced.

## Fidelity model

This guide targets evidence-based fidelity, not certification. Evaluate each requirement as:

1. Design intent and applicable official reference identified.
2. Flutter capability verified at the selected SDK.
3. Platform-specific behavior accounted for.
4. Interaction, accessibility, responsive behavior, and appearance checked.
5. Deviations and unknowns recorded.

See the [visual verification checklist](ai-agent-guide/validation-checklist.md).
